What is a Flowchart?
        A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps of a process or algorithm using different shapes and arrows to indicate the flow of control.
        It’s like a map of your program’s logic — you can follow the arrows to see what happens next.

2. Why Use a Flowchart?
      Makes complex logic easy to understand.
      Helps in planning before coding.
      Useful for documentation.
      Makes debugging easier (you can trace where the problem might occur).

 Assignment Operator =>>
The = operator in most programming languages does not mean equality (that’s usually ==).
                Instead, it assigns the value on the right-hand side (RHS) to the variable on the left-hand side (LHS).
                Operator Categories in Java
                                Arithmetic Operators → +, -, *, /, %
                                Relational Operators → ==, !=, <, >, <=, >
                                Logical Operators → &&, ||, !
                                Assignment Operators → =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
                                Unary Operators → ++, --, +, -
                                Bitwise Operators → &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
                                Ternary Operator → condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
