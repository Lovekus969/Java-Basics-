What is a Flowchart?
        A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the steps of a process or algorithm using different shapes and arrows to indicate the flow of control.
        It’s like a map of your program’s logic — you can follow the arrows to see what happens next.

2. Why Use a Flowchart?
      Makes complex logic easy to understand.
      Helps in planning before coding.
      Useful for documentation.
      Makes debugging easier (you can trace where the problem might occur).
