What is Binary Search?
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array.
        Idea: Repeatedly divide the search interval in half.
        Time Complexity: O(log n)
        Space Complexity: O(1) (iterative version)
$$ Conditions for Binary Search
        The data must be sorted (ascending or descending). You must have random access (like arrays, not linked lists).
