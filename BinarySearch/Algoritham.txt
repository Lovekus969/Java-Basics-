What is Binary Search?
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array.
        Idea: Repeatedly divide the search interval in half.
        Time Complexity: O(log n)
        Space Complexity: O(1) (iterative version)
$$ Conditions for Binary Search
        The data must be sorted (ascending or descending). You must have random access (like arrays, not linked lists).


Q1 First Occurrence of an Element

 Problem: Given a sorted array with duplicates, return the index of the first occurrence of a target element. If not found, return -1.
Q2 Last Occurrence of an Element

ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Same as above, but return the last occurrence.
